        Tech Shed Frome Code of Conduct
      </h1>

      <p class="subtitle">
        All attendees, sponsors, partners, volunteers and staff at any of our events are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organisers will enforce this code throughout all events. We are expecting cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe environment for everybody.
      </p>

     Tech Shed Frome Code of conduct, kindly borrowed from <a href="https://www.bathhacked.org/code-of-conduct/"> bathhacked </a> and <a href="http://hackcodeofconduct.org/">Hack code of conduct </a>

    <h4>In summary</h4>
      
    Our events are dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, 
    regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, 
    disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, nationality, 
    religion, previous event attendance or computing experience 
    (or lack of any of the aforementioned). We do not tolerate harassment 
    of event participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is 
    not appropriate at any event venue, including hacks, talks, workshops, 
    parties, social media and other online media. Event participants violating 
    these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the event without a refund 
    (if applicable) at the discretion of the event organisers.<br><br>
      <h4> The long answer</h4>
      Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, photography or audio/video recording against reasonable consent, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.
<br><br>
Photography is encouraged, but other participants must be given a reasonable chance to opt-out from being photographed. If they object to the taking of their photograph, comply with their request. It is inappropriate to take photographs in contexts where people have a reasonable expectation of privacy (in bathrooms or where participants are sleeping).
<br><br>
Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
<br><br>
We would like to explicitly note that the projects created at our events are equally subject to the anti-harassment policy.
<br><br>
Sponsors and partners are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material. Sponsor representatives (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.
<br><br>
If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact one of the event staff.
<br><br>
Event staff will be happy to help participants contact any local security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value your attendance.
<br><br>
If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the event organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event and/or future events with no refund (if applicable).
<br><br>
We expect participants to follow these rules at any event, workshop, venue, and any hack-related social events, such as curators nights or steering group meetings.
