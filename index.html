    <h3 class="subtitle">What is techshed?</h3 class="subtitle">
    A group of technology enthusiasts that get together each week in social space to ‘tinker’... with everything from
    circuit boards, programming, lasers, websites, apps, 3d printers.

    <h4>For the community</h4>
    We identify problems by connecting to the town council and local businesses, to create interesting and technological
    solutions to that benefit the community.

    <strong>Can I help out on a project?</strong>
    See our a problem board that lists all the on-going projects.

    If you think you can add something to it, from the marketing, to the design or the coding then you can buddy up with
    the team.

    Or you might have identified a new problem that technology can solve in the wider community.
