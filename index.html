    <h3>What is techshed?</h3>
    A group of technology enthusiasts that get together each week in social space to ‘tinker’... with everything from
    circuit boards, programming, lasers, websites, apps, 3d printers.

    <h4>For the community</h4>
    We identify problems by connecting to the town council and local businesses, to create interesting and technological
    solutions to that benefit the community.

    <strong>Can I help out on a project?</strong>
    See our a problem board that lists all the on-going projects.

    If you think you can add something to it, from the marketing, to the design or the coding then you can buddy up with
    the team.

    Or you might have identified a new problem that technology can solve in the wider community.


    <h3>For Tinkerists...</h3>
    Work on a personal project, tinker or try out or get support with. You will have full access to all of our kit.

</ul>

<h3 class="">Who should get involved?</h3>
We welcome everyone who’s interested in the community and using technology to make it a better place. Below are the sorts of useful roles that some members bring to Techshed Frome :-

Developers – What is perhaps surprising is the amazing diversity of skills and experience you’ll find among our members. There’s always something to learn for beginners and experts alike; from each other and from the groundbreaking work we’re doing with data. Come and help us make useful things.
Datanauts – Do you have or know of data we can use? Can you analyse or visualise data like a boss? Do you just love data? Then Bath: Hacked is for you.
Designers – If we’re going to build things that are useful for the people of B&NES, they need to look great and work smoothly – in other words they need design and a bit of magic. If you’re a designer or even do magic, we’d love to have you on board.
Organisers – Our events and connections with people and other organisations don’t happen by accident – they happen because we’re organised (well most of the time). If you can help to make us even more organised or just enjoy rolling your sleeves up, you should jump in.
Communicators – An important aspect of what we do at Bath: Hacked is sharing our work and experiences within our local area and also with cities and districts around the world. If you can write a great blog post, rock a slide deck or set social media on fire, then you should come and help us share.
Financial Folk – In order to secure the long term benefits of what we do, we need to deal with everyday finances – budgeting, planning, reporting and fundraising. If that’s your area of expertise, we can always use your help.
Educators – We’re gathering and sharing a lot of information about our area and the communities we live in – powerful resources for teaching citizens of tomorrow about the world around them. Come and talk to us about how we can deliver data in ways that will fit your teaching goals.
Community Groups – If you’re a member of another local community group and think that our groups may be able to help each other, you should absolutely get involved. We’d really like to increase our engagement with all groups across the area.

<strong>Can I chat to someone before I come?</strong>
Sure why not chat to the team and we will do our best to make you feel at home

<strong>Will you fix my laptop or tech kit?</strong>
We don’t fix stuff on our own, but if you bring it along you may find another member can help or give you pointers.  It can be your next project.

<strong>I don’t feel very confident about technology am I welcome? </strong>
Yes!  Whilst we don’t offer lessons or any courses, if you are willing to try, mess it up and try again, a member will be happy to show you the basics.  You might also be interested in coming to an open day
