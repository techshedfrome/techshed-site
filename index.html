                <h4>For the community</h4>
                <p>
                    We identify problems by connecting to the town council and local businesses, to create interesting
                    and
                    technological solutions to that benefit the community.
                </p>
                <strong>Can I help out on a project?</strong>
                <p>
                    See our a problem board that lists all the on-going projects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you think you can add something to it, from the marketing, to the design or the coding then you
                    can buddy up with the team.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Or you might have identified a new problem that technology can solve in the wider community.
